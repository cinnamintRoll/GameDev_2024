# 🎮 GameDev Compilation 2024

Welcome to my Game Development Compilation for Year 4, Term 1!  
This repository features work that covers everything from foundational vector math to dynamic particle systems like explosions and fireworks.

## 🧠 Features & Skills Demonstrated

- 🔧 **Vector Math**: Direction, magnitude, and force-based calculations.
- 💥 **Particle effects** (explosions, fireworks)
- ⌛ Real-time simulation techniques
- 🧩 **Scene Logic**: Structuring rooms and simulations for predictable behavior.
- 🗂️ **Project Organization**: Clean file/folder hierarchy and naming conventions.
- 🖋️ **TextMesh Pro Integration**: Clear UI with modern text rendering.
